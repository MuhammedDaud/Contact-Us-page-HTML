Contact Us Web Page

 Overview

This project is a responsive "Contact Us" web page with a modern, visually appealing design. The page features a glassmorphism effect for the contact form, a gradient background with smooth transitions, and a raindrop animation that adds a dynamic, interactive feel to the user experience.

Features

- Responsive Design: The page is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- Glassmorphism Effect: The contact form is styled with a glass effect, creating a frosted glass appearance that blends beautifully with the gradient background.
- Gradient Background Animation: The background features a smooth, animated gradient that shifts colors over time, adding a modern touch to the page.
- Raindrop Animation: A subtle raindrop effect is implemented in the background, with droplets falling at random positions and intervals, enhancing the visual appeal.
- Customizable Form: The form includes fields for the user's name, email, subject, and message, and can be easily customized to include additional fields if necessary.
- Attribution: The page includes a footer note with the text "Developed by Daud."
